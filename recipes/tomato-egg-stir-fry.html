    <h4>What is it..?</h4>
    This affordable, quick dish is easy to make and goes perfectly over a bed of rice.  For many Chinese people it's a staple, home-cooked comfort food with every family having their own variation.  All you  need is tomatoes, eggs, and a few tasty sauces and seasonings to make it your own!  This version is my personal creation, but feel free to get creative with it.
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium tomatoes (1 pound)</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 scallion</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp white pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp shaoxing wine</li>
        <li>1 tsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tamari</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp avocado oil</li>
        <li>1/4-1/2 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the tomatoes into small wedges and finely chop the scallion</li>
        <li>In a bowl, wisk together the eggs, pepper, sesame oil, and Shaoxing wine.</li>
        <li>Preheat the wok or frying pan over medium heat until it just starts to smoke.  Then add the oil and immediately add the eggs.  Scramble the eggs and remove from the pan as soon as they're cooked.  Set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the wok, turn up the heat to high, and add the tomatoes and scallions.  Stir-fry for 1 minute, then add sugar, oyster sauce, tamari, and water.  Add the cooked eggs.</li>
        <li>Mix everything together, cover the wok, and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the tomatoes are completely softened.</li>
        <li>Uncover and continue to stir-fry over high heat until the sauce thickens to your liking.</li>
        <li>Serve over a bed of warm rice.  Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

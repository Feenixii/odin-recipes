    <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare your vegetables first by dicing your onion, carrots, beets, potatoes and chop the cabbage into ribbons.  You can also grate your carrots and beets for a finer texture.</li>
            <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil to medium high heat then add diced carrots and onion to sautee for about 5 minutes, stirring often.  If your beets are diced, you can sautee them as well at this time, but if they're grated add them in the next step.</li>
            <li>Add hot vegetable broth, diced potatoes, chopped cabbage, bay leaves, and any grated veggies to the pot, put the lid on and cook for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add lemon juice, tomato paste, cannellini beans, minced garlic, chopped dill, and salt and pepper to the pot.  Cover and cook for 5 more minutes.  Let rest with the lid on for 15 more minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>Garnish with a spoonful of sour cream and more fresh dill.  Serve with rye bread and pickles.  Enjoy!</li>

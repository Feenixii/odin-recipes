    <h4>What is it..?</h4>
    Latin America's take on stuffed peppers, chile rellenos is typically made using poblano peppers, but other peppers can be used instead if you can't find them.  The poblano is a really nice pepper that's not particularly spicy, but packs a powerful flavor punch.  Traditionally, they are first roasted, then stuffed with cheese and coated in a fluffy egg batter; fried until golden brown and served over salsa.  You can add additional stuffings like meat, rice, or beans to spice them up!

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large poblano peppers</li>
        <li>8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, cut into long strips or shredded</li>
        <li>4 cups oil, for frying</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-pourpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Roast the peppers on a baking sheet by placing directly on the top rack under the broiler for about 5 minutes or until the skin is blackened and blistered.  Flip them over and broil another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and cover with foil to let them steam for 5 minutes, then peel the skin from the peppers.</li>
        <li>Cut a small slit down the middle of the pepper to allow them to be stuffed.  If you don't want the peppers too spicy, remove the seeds.</li>
        <li>Stuff the peppers with cheese carefully.  They will be delicate from the roasting process.</li>
        <li>Gently close the openings of the peppers and secure it shut with a few toothpicks.  Use as many toothpicks as is necessary to ensure the cheese won't ooze out during the frying process.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large sauce pan or deep skillet over medium-high heat.  While the oil is heating, prepare the batter.</li>
        <li>Separate the egg whites from the yolks in 2 bowls.  Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.  While continuing to beat the whites, add in the yolks one at a time until they're fully incorporated.  The batter should be light, fluffy, and smooth.</li>
        <li>Mix the flour and salt together in a shallow bowl and coat the peppers.  Then dip them in the egg batter and place gently in the hot frying oil.</li>
        <li>Fry the peppers for 3-5 minutes per side or until the batter is golden brown and crispy.  Transfer to a paper towel lined baking sheet to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve on a plate over salsa and enjoy!</li>
